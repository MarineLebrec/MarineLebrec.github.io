## Benthic habitat modeling using GIS 
I have been leading an international working group focused on benthic habitat mapping and modeling as part of the NSF-funded ["Deep Ocean Observing Strategy"](https://www.deepoceanobserving.org/). As part of this effort, I collaborated with other researchers and industry partners (Esri, Fugro) to develop a seafloor habitat model for the U.S. West Coast, using multi-variate clustering to model unique habitats based on environmentally-relevant drivers. These kinds of GIS products can be useful for informing place-based management, including offshore wind industries, understanding Marine Protected Areas, and informing where future research & observations should take place. 
You can learn more this project in this [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f453ff55688747509bf9adda989df110) and on our [working group webpage](https://www.deepoceanobserving.org/pages/habitat).
