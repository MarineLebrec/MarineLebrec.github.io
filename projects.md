## Benthic habitat modeling using GIS 
For the last two yars, I have been leading an international working group focused on benthic habitat mapping and modeling as part of the NSF-funded ["Deep Ocean Observing Strategy"](https://www.deepoceanobserving.org/). As part of this effort, I collaborated with other researchers and industry partners (Esri, Fugro) to develop a seafloor habitat model for the U.S. West Coast, using multi-variate clustering to model unique habitats based on environmentally-relevant drivers.
