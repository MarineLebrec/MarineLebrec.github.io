## Benthic habitat modeling using GIS 
I have been leading an international working group focused on benthic habitat mapping and modeling as part of the NSF-funded ["Deep Ocean Observing Strategy"](https://www.deepoceanobserving.org/). As part of this effort, I collaborated with other researchers and industry partners (Esri, Fugro) to develop a seafloor habitat model for the U.S. West Coast, using multi-variate clustering to model unique habitats based on environmentally-relevant drivers. These kinds of GIS products can be useful for informing place-based management, including offshore wind industries, understanding Marine Protected Areas, and informing where future research & observations should take place. 
You can learn more this project in this [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f453ff55688747509bf9adda989df110) and on our [working group webpage](https://www.deepoceanobserving.org/pages/habitat).

## Access to real-time ocean information
As a technical manager for the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS), one of my primary responsibilities is to help make data accessible through web products, including data portals, dashboards, and APIs. This work involves everything from: 
- Creating data pipelines to ensure data are continuously flowing to an end point
- Standardizing data and metadata to adhere to national and international standards
- Developing easy to use web-based tools for data access & visualization
- Communicating these products to end users to improve these tools and ensure folks are finding them valuable

## Microfluidic nutrient sensor method development
As a graduate student at San Jose State University's Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, I helped develop new methods for measuring silicate and phosphate in seawater, two key nutrients for sustaining life in the ocean. As part of this work, I collaborated with chemists, engineers, and computer scientists to build a low-cost analyzer, which I deployed at a coastal shore station. We developed the first iteration of a Python-based software to control the instrument remotely and log data. With this instrument, I was able to capture hourly nutrient measurements at the head of the Monterey Bay canyon, and brought the instrument to the Hawai'i Ocean Time Series to collect samples from the surface to 5000 meters! My thesis work culminated in the publication of a manuscript, which you can read here: [Lebrec & Grand 2024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1354780).
