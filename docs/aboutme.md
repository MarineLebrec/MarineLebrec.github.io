# About Me

Welcome to my personal website! <br><br>
My name is Marine Lebrec, I am an oceanographer and data scientist passionate about understanding and visualizing the complexities of our oceans. <br><br>
With a background in chemical oceanography, GIS, and programming, I specialize in transforming complex environmental datasets into accessible products. 

### Education

During my graduate studies at Moss Landing Marine Labs, I helped develop new methods for measuring phosphate and silicate in seawater using microfluidic analyzers, and built new open-source software for these instruments. 
This allowed me to gain hands on training in a chemistry lab, at sea on research vessels, and behind a computer building out my software engineering and data analysis skills. <br> My thesis work culminated in the publication of a manuscript, which you can read here: [Lebrec & Grand 2024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1354780). 

### Work

**University of Washington** - After finishing my undergraduate studies at the University of Washington (go huskies!), I worked at the UW Applied Physics Laboratories as an oceanographer. In this role, I led research cruises around Puget Sound to better understand the status and impacts of ocean acidification in the region, as part of the [Washington Ocean Acidification Center](https://oceanacidification.uw.edu/). This role also allowed me to work closely with software engineers and web developers to make ocean data accessible through web platforms, such as the [NANOOS Visualization System](https://nvs.nanoos.org/).

**International Atomic Energy Agency** -
