# About Me

Welcome to my personal website! <br><br>
My name is Marine Lebrec, I am an oceanographer and data scientist passionate about understanding and visualizing the complexities of our oceans. <br><br>
With a background in chemical oceanography, GIS, and programming, I specialize in transforming complex environmental datasets into accessible products. I have 8 years of experiencing working in academia, private research institutions, and international agencies tackling pressing challenges such as climate change, ecosystem monitoring, and resource management.

During my graduate studies at Moss Landing Marine Labs (2020 - 2022), I helped develop new methods for measuring phosphate and silicate in seawater using microfluidic analyzers, and built new open-source software for these instruments. 
This allowed me to gain hands on training in a chemistry lab, at sea on research vessels, and behind a computer building out my software engineering and data analysis skills. My thesis work culminated in the publication of a manuscript, which you can read here: [Lebrec & Grand 2024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1354780). 

### Work

**Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute  (2022 - present)** As a Technical Manager for the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System, I work with oceanographic data across the entire data life cycle, from collection to the delivery of the data in usable and digestable formats. Through this role, I have become proficient in programming languages (Python, R, Matlab, Bash) and web development skills (HTML, JavaScript) for building data pipelines, visualization tools, and robust analyses. I regularly work with many different types of oceanographic data, ranging from satellite imagery, computer model outputs, biological data, and other in situ instruments.

**International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (2018 - 2020)** - My role at the United Nations IAEA Environmental Laboratories in Monaco consisted of managing large databases and data portals relevant to global ocean acidification observing efforts (e.g. the [GOA-ON Data Portal](https://portal.goa-on.org/Explorer)). I also helped coordinate and organize capacity building training courses and contribute to UN Sustainable Developemnt Goals deliverables. I was involved in publishing this work, available here: [Tilbrook et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00337/full).

**University of Washington (2016 - 2018)** - After finishing my undergraduate studies at the University of Washington (go huskies!), I worked at the UW Applied Physics Laboratories as an oceanographer. In this role, I led research cruises around Puget Sound to better understand the status and impacts of ocean acidification in the region as part of the [Washington Ocean Acidification Center](https://oceanacidification.uw.edu/). This role also allowed me to work closely with software engineers and web developers to make ocean data accessible through web platforms, such as the [NANOOS Visualization System](https://nvs.nanoos.org/).
