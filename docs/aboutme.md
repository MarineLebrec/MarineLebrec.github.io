# About Me

Howdy, welcome to my personal website! 
My name is Marine Lebrec, I am an oceanographer and data scientist passionate about understanding and visualizing the complexities of our oceans. 
With a background in chemical oceanography, GIS, and programming, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into accessible products.

My education and work background has focused on bridging the gap between science and technology.
As a graduate student, I helped develop new methods for measuring phosphate and silicate in seawater using microfluidic analyzers and helped build out new open-source software for these instruments. 
This allowed me to gain hands on training in a chemistry lab, at sea on research vessels, and behind a computer building out my software engineering and data analysis skills. My thesis work culminated in the publication of a manuscript, which you can read here: [Lebrec & Grand 2024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1354780).
